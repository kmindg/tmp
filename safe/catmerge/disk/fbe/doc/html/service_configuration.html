<h1>Configuration Service</h1>
<p>
The configuration service manages the configured nature of the objects in the storage extent package.
</p>
<p>
If an object is configured in SEP the configuration service is responsible for the authoritative definition
of both the object and its edges to other objects.
All object/edge conflicts are resolved using the configuration metadata.
</p>
<p>
The configuration service maintains its metadata in three run-time tables:
<ul>
    <li><i>Object Table</i> &mdash; all of the configured objects.</li>
    <li><i>Edge Table</i> &mdash; all of the edges between configured objects.</li>
    <li><i>User Id Table</i> &mdash; mappings between user identifiers and
    the object ids of the configured objects (e.g., a LUN WWN is mapped to its object id).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The configuration service keeps its tables coherent across SPs by adopting either an active
or passive role in the service itself.
The active service (on one SP) provides all of the stimulus for creating and updating the
tables of the passive service (on the other SP).
The active service communicates with the passive service using CMI messages sent via the
CMI service.
</p>
<p>
The active service keeps its tables persistent in the configuration database.
It does this indirectly using the persistence service (which is responsible for maintaining
the records of the database).
The passive service does not access the configuration database.
The configuration database is stored in a triple-mirror, system lun on the system drives.

</p>
<p>
The generalized flow for creating configured objects and edges is as follows:
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
    <li>On the active SP, metadata for configured objects and edges is read from the
    configuration database and stored in run-time tables.</li>
    <li>On the active SP, objects and edges are created based on the metadata read from
    the configuration database.  As a part of this, CMI messages are sent
    to the passive SP to create corresponding objects and edges.</li>
    <li>The passive SP creates the corresponding objects and edges based on the incoming
    CMI messages.</li>
    <li>On the active SP, when new objects and edges are added to the system, updates are made to the
    configuration database via the persistence service.</li>
    <li>The persistence service makes transactional updates to the triple mirror database.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The configuration service creates all of the configured objects and edges when the package
is itself initialized.
The objects are created without regard to whether the underlying hardware is present,
e.g., if the drives of a raid group are not present the raid group object is still created,
although in this case it will not become ready for I/O.
</p>
<h2>System Object Initialization</h2>
<p>
Before the configuration database can be accessed (by the persistence service) the configuration
service must first create the "system objects" needed to support the LUN containing the database.
These system objects are preconfigured (hard-coded) in the configuration service itself.
They have fixed object ids and the system drives themselves are at fixed physical locations
(bus 0, enclosure 0, and slots 0, 1, and 2).

<h2>Configuration Service Characteristics</h2>
<p>
There are three primary code flows in the configuration service:
<ul>
    <li>Service control port &mdash; receives and processes request packets.</li>
    <li>Peer monitor thread &mdash; receives and processes peer requests.</li>
    <li>Disk monitor thread &mdash; receives drive related notifications and makes PVD
        updates as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Service Control Port</h3>
<p>
The service control port is the entry point for receiving request packets to change,
the configuration, e.g., to create new objects and edges, or to delete existing objects
and edges.
Configuration operations performed via the control port occur in the context of the sender
of the request packet.
In general this context will be either a job service job thread, or the peer monitor thread
when processing CMI messages.
</p>
<h3>Peer Monitor Thread</h3>
<p>
The configuration service uses its peer monitor thread to maintain the CMI connection to its
counterpart configuration service on the peer SP.
On the active SP this thread is mostly idle, its role is primarily active/passive handshaking.
On the passive side this thread receives and processes peer requests to update its run-time
(in memory) configuration.
</p>
<h3>Disk Monitor Thread</h3>
<p>
When the configuration service is first initialized, its disk monitor thread reads
the configuration database and creates the configured objects and edges.
Inherent in this, it creates the system objects needed to access the database and provides the
persistence service with the database LUN identifier.
</p>
<p>
After this initialization phase completes, the disk monitor thread interacts with the physical package
to receive and process drive change notifications.
In particular, it monitors when new drives are inserted in the system and when existing drives
are removed from the system.
</p>
<p>
When drives are removed, the disk monitor will detach the edge between the PVD object
and the downstream logical drive.
The PVD object will transition to the ACTIVATE state, and I/O to the drive will be stopped.
</p>
<p>
When drives are inserted one of two things can happen.  If the drive corresponds to a configured
PVD object, then that PVD object will already exist in the package topology.
In this case, the drive monitor will create an edge between the existing PVD object and the new
logical drive object.  Once this edge is created the PVD object will progress through its ACTIVATE rotary
in order to reach its READY state.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if the inserted drive does not correspond with a configured PVD object,
the drive monitor will create a new PVD object.
It will also create a downstream edge between this new PVD object and the new logical drive.
The new PVD will not have any upstream edges and will not be written into the configuration
database.
However, it can be used as a hot spare, or the user can configure it in a new raid group.

<h2>Database Service Source Files</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>./disk/fbe/interface/fbe_database.h</li>
    <li>./disk/fbe/src/services/database/src/*.h</li>
    <li>./disk/fbe/src/services/database/src/*.c</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Configuration Service Transactions</h2>
<p>
Any changes to configured objects ( creation/modification/deletion ) within the configuration service are performed within the context of a transaction. Transactions will be co-ordinated between SPs. The following rules apply to transactions within the configuration service.
<ul>
<li>Only one transaction can be in progress at any time</li>
    <li>No changes to any objects are persisted until the transaction has been committed</li>
    <li>If any errors occur within a transaction then the transaction can never be commited and must be aborted</li>
    <li>After aborting a transaction all objects will be reverted to their state before the transaction started ( both the in-memory and persisted images )</li>
    <li>A transaction cannot be initiated on a passive node</li>
    <li>The active node will not complete it's transaction commit until the passive node has sucessfully finished it's commit
    <li>An abort on the active node will cause to passive to to abort too</li?
    <li>An error on either the active or passive node will cause both nodes to require the transaction to be aborted</li>
</ul>
</p>
The configuration service will allow some requests to proceed with a transaction. Any requests that do not cause objects to be created/destroyed or modified can be processed outside the bounds of a transaction.
