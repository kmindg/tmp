<h1>Job Service</h1>
<p>
The job service performs operations that must be coordinated across multiple objects in a package.
Currently the job service is used only in the storage extent package.
In the storage extent package the operations performed by the job services are:
<ul>
    <li>Drive sparing.</li>
    <li>Raid group create and delete.</li>
    <li>LUN create and delete.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
To create a job, a client of the job service sends it a job request.
These job requests are queued and the job queues are drained by a single job thread.
The job thread runs jobs serially, one at a time, in a prioritized order.
</p>
<p>
The serialization of jobs is an important property of the job service.
Because of this, the actions to perform a job do not need to protect
against a concurrently running job.
</p>
<p>
Serialization is enforced across SPs using an active/passive designation.
When both SPs are up, only one SP will have an active job service running jobs.
The queues of the passive job service will be synchronized with the queues of the active job service,
but the passive job service will not run jobs.
</p>
<p>
There are two job queues, the recovery queue and the create queue.
These queues prioritize recovery operations ahead of create operations.
Jobs in the recovery queue are fully drained before any jobs in the create queue are processed.
The jobs in each queue are drained in FIFO order.
</p>
<h2>Job Flow</h2>
<p>
The general flow of a job is depicted in the following diagram.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../png/service_job.png" />
</p>
<p>
The major steps of this flow are as follows:
<p><div id="logic_flow">
<ol type=A>
    <li>A client creates a job-request packet and sends it to the job service's control port.
    </li>
    <li>The job service allocates a job-control queue element,
    populates this with the job parameters from the request packet,
    and pushes it onto the appropriate queue.
    </li>
    <li>After queueing the element, the job service completes the job-request packet.
    Note that the completion of the request packet does not return job status,
    it only indicates whether the job was placed on a job queue.
    </li>
    <li>While still in the client's calling context,
    the job service releases the job-semaphore to wake-up the job thread.
    </li>
    <li>The job thread examines the job queues and, in priority order,
    selects a job-control-element to process.
    </li>
    <li>
    The job-control-element is placed in a control operation in a job-control-packet;
    then the job thread drops into a loop that invokes the action functions that perform the job.
    </li>
    <li>
    The job loop determines the next action function to call,
    and it calls the corresponding action function using a static table of action function pointers.
    It passes the job-control-packet as a parameter to the action function.
    </li>
    <li>
    After calling the action function the job thread waits for the job-control-packet
    to be completed by the action function.
    When the job-control-packet completes the job thread semaphore is released and the job loop continues.
    The job loop iterates calling action functions until the job completes.
    </li>
</ol>
</div></p>
</p>
<h2>Job Action Functions</h2>
<p>
The job service implements a framework for running jobs,
but the actual work of a job is performed by a set of action functions.
There is a different set of action functions for each type of job.
The mapping of a job type to the corresponding action functions is made through a static table of function pointers.
This table contains the following pointers:
</p>
<p><div id="type_struct">
<table>
    <caption>Job Action Functions</caption>
    <tr><td>validation_p()</td>
        <td>Validate that the job can be performed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>selection_p()</td>
        <td>Select the objects needed for the job.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>update_in_memory_p()</td>
        <td>Make any in-memory changes needed for the job.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>persist_in_db_p()</td>
        <td>Make any in database changes needed for the job.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>rollback_p()</td>
        <td>Rollback all changes, only called on an error or cancel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>commit_p()</td>
        <td>Commit the job changes.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</div></p>
<p>
In the job loop the first four action functions (validation, selection, update-in-memory and persist-in-db)
are called in sequence -- as long as each returns an "ok" status.
Status is returned by setting the status of the control operation
in the job-control-packet and completing the packet.
</p>
<p>
If all of the first four functions return "ok", the commit function is called.
If any of these functions return an error status, the rollback function is called.
The commit and rollback are mutually exclusive, only one will be called.
</p>
<p>
The return status of the the commit/rollback is not evaluated by the job service.
After either of these functions completes, the job is finished and it is released.
The job service framework does not notify the client when a job completes.
It is the responsibility of the rollback/commit functions to notify the client if such notification is required.
