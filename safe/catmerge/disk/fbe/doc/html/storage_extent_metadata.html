<a name="storageextentmetadata"><h1>Storage Extent Metadata</h1></a>
<p>
Storage extent metadata is used by the back-end software to describe the nature of a storage extent.
Specifically, this metadata is used to:
<ul>
    <li>Describe the extent's configured characteristics.</li>
    <li>Describe the extent's temporal state in relation to control operations.</li>
    <li>Frame a storage extent on a user drive.</li>
</ul>
The back-end software objects that have this metadata are:
Lun objects, Raid objects, Virtual Drive objects and Provision Drive objects.
</p>
<p>
There are four categories of storage extent metadata:
<ul>
    <li><a href="#configurationdata">Configuration Data</a></li>
    <li><a href="#nonpagedmetadata">Non-paged Metadata</a></li>
    <li><a href="#extentsignatures">Extent Signatures</a></li>
    <li><a href="#pagedmetadata">Paged Metadata</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Configuration data and non-paged metadata are stored in system luns on the system drives.
</p>
<p>
Extent signatures and paged metadata are stored in conjunction with the user data on
<a href="#userdrivemetadata">user drives</a>.
<p>
Configuration data is managed by the <a href="../html/service_configuration.html">configuration service</a>.
</p>
<p>
Paged and Non-paged metadata is managed by the <a href="../html/service_metadata.html">metadata service</a>.
</p>
<a name="configurationdata"><h2>Configuration Data</h2></a>
<p>
Configuration data is used to create storage extent objects and to establish the edges between them.
It is the authoritative definition of the storage extents known on the system.
</p>
<p>
The configuration service keeps a run-time version of the configuration data in memory.
It keeps this coherent between SPs and also with its lun on the system drives.
</p>
<p>
When the configuration service creates an object, it provides the object with its configuration data.
The object uses this data to verify the <a href="#extentsignatures">extent signatures</a> found on the drive.
</p>
<a name="nonpagedmetadata"><h2>Non-paged Metadata</h2></a>
<p>
Every instance of a configured storage extent has a block of non-paged metadata.
This block contains dynamic control data that can be accessed at run-time in the normal I/O data path.
Changes in non-paged metadata are managed by the metadata service and are coherent across SPs.
</p>
<p>
During run-time, non-paged metadata resides in vaulted cache memory.
A copy of the run-time metadata is also stored on the system drives in a dedicated system lun.
The metadata service periodically updates the persistent copy on the system drives as a background operation.
During a normal shutdown the metadata service will sync the run-time metadata
with the persistent metadata prior to the shutdown.
After a system abort, the vaulted run-time metadata is used to recover run-time updates
to the metadata prior to the abort.
</p>
<p>
The content of a non-paged metadata block varies according to the type of storage extent object.
This content is described in the following object descriptions.
<ul>
    <li><a href="../html/object_lun.html#nonpagedmetadata">LUN Object Non-paged Metadata</a></li>
    <li><a href="../html/object_raid.html#nonpagedmetadata">Raid Object Non-paged Metadata</a></li>
    <li><a href="../html/object_virtual_drive.html#nonpagedmetadata">Virtual Drive Object Non-paged Metadata</a></li>
    <li><a href="../html/object_provision_drive.html#nonpagedmetadata">Provision Drive Object Non-paged Metadata</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<a name="extentsignatures"><h2>Extent Signatures</h2></a>
<p>
Extent Signatures are static signature blocks, created when a storage extent is first configured on a drive.
Signatures are used to validate that a storage extent found on a drive matches the data in the configuration database.
</p>
Signatures are written to the last chunk of the extent.
There are two copies of the signature in the signature chunk.
It is divided into two halves and the signature is written at the beginning of each half.
The remainder of each half is reserved space, and is currently unused.
</p>
<img src="../png/storage_extent_metadata_02.png" />
<p>
A signature contains the following:
<ul>
    <li><i>Class Id</i> &mdash; the leaf class Id of the object associated with the extent, i.e., its object type.</li>
    <li><i>Object Id</i> &mdash; the configured object id of the object associated with the extent.</li>
    <li><i>Generation Number</i> &mdash; the generation number of the object id.</li>
    <li><i>WWN or Serial Number</i> &mdash; for lun and raid objects the world wide name of the extent,
    for Virtual and Provision Drive objects the serial number of the physical drive.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Once a signature chunk is written to a drive, it remains unchanged on the drive
over the life of its corresponding storage extent.
</p>
<p>
The storage extent object creates and reads its signature blocks directly.
</p>
<a name="pagedmetadata"><h2>Paged Metadata</h2></a>
<p>
Paged Metadata describes the temporal state of the user data in a storage extent.
Each chunk of user data has a corresponding bit sequence in the paged metadata.
The meaning of the bits in a chunk's sequence vary according to the type of extent object.
For example, the provision drive paged metadata has a bit that indicates whether a chunk
needs to be zeroed and another bit that indicates whether the chunk has been consumed by a LUN.
Whereas, the Raid Group object has groups of bits within the chunk sequence that apply to each
of the drives in the raid group.
</p>
<p>
The meanings of the bits are described in the following object descriptions.
<ul>
    <li><a href="../html/object_lun.html#pagedmetadata">LUN Object Paged Metadata</a></li>
    <li><a href="../html/object_raid.html#pagedmetadata">Raid Object Paged Metadata</a></li>
    <li><a href="../html/object_virtual_drive.html#pagedmetadata">Virtual Drive Object Paged Metadata</a></li>
    <li><a href="../html/object_provision_drive.html#pagedmetadata">Provision Drive Object Paged Metadata</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<img src="../png/storage_extent_metadata_03.png" />
<p>
Paged metadata is stored on the drive as part of the storage extent.
It is paged into memory on an as-needed basis.
The storage extent object reads and writes its paged metadata by using the metadata service.
The metadata service maintains a cache of active metadata pages and
provides coherency between the cached pages on both SPs, as well as with the pages on the drive itself.
</p>
<p>
Paged metadata is used for control operations that are performed in the background.
These include:
<ul>
    <li>Raid Group Verify.</li>
    <li>Raid Group Rebuild.</li>
    <li>Virtual Drive Copy.</li>
    <li>Provision Drive zeroing.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Because of the latencies resulting from keeping paged metadata coherent,
typical I/O flows do not read or write paged metadata.
Whether or not an I/O is affected by paged metadata is determined by checkpoints.
These checkpoints are maintained in non-paged metadata.
</p>
<p>
For example, when performing rebuilds, the raid group object maintains a checkpoint
of the lowest chunk in the extent that requires a rebuild.
If incoming I/Os fall below the checkpoint then the paged metadata is not consulted.
If incoming I/Os are above the checkpoint then the paged metadata is read,
and if need be, the chunk is rebuilt prior to servicing the I/O.
In the typical case, where the raid group object is not performing a rebuild,
all of the I/Os fall below the checkpoint and the paged metadata is not referenced.
</p>
<a name="userdrivemetadata"><h2>User-drive Metadata</h2></a>
<p>
The data stored in a storage extent on a user drive (both user data and metadata)
is allocated and aligned in units of "chunks".
The size of a chunk is fixed relative to all of the extents on a drive, and it is roughly a megabyte in size.
The metadata chunks are position at the end of the storage extent on the drive,
with the extent signature as the last chunk.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../png/storage_extent_metadata_01.png" />
</p>
<a name="driveextentnesting"><h3>User-drive Storage Extent Nesting</h3></a>
Because the metadata on the drives is stored adjacent to its associated storage extent,
it is nested on the drives (as are the storage extents themselves).
For example, a virtual drive extent is nested in the storage extent exported by the provision drive.
The raid group extents on a drive are nested in the storage extent exported by the virtual drive.
The lun extents in a raid group are nested in the storage extent exported by the raid group.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../png/storage_extent_metadata_04.png" />
</p>
<a name="drivemetadataprotection"><h3>User-drive Metadata Protection</h3></a>
<p>
The metadata stored on the drives has its own protection characteristics.
These vary depending on both the type of metadata and also the type of storage extent.
</p>
<p>
Extent signatures are protected by writing two copies of the signature in the signature chunk.
Corruption in one of the signatures is handled when signatures are verified.
During verification both copies are compared to the corresponding configuration data.
When a single corrupt signature is found, it is rebuilt from the configuration data.
If during verification both copies do not match the configuration data the storage extent object
will enter the failed state.
</p>
<p>
The paged metadata of the provision drive is protected by storing two copies of the metadata within the extent.
If the data in one chunk becomes corrupt (e.g., because of a media error) it is rebuilt from the second copy.
</p>
<p>
The paged metadata for the virtual drive and for raid objects is protected by the raid protection scheme of the storage extent.
</p>
<p>
The virtual drive in normal operations does not use its paged metadata.
However, during sparing operations the virtual drive becomes a raid-1 mirror.
As a consequence, its paged metadata is protected in the same manner as a raid-1 mirror.
</p>
<p>
Because the paged metadata of a raid object is protected using the protection scheme of the raid group,
there is a need for a small amount of additional metadata to cover the paged metadata itself.
This "metadata for the metadata" is located in the object's non-paged metadata.
It contains the same bit sequences as does the paged metadata.
